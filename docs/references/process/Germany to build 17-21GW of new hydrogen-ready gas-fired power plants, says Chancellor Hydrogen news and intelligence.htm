  Germany to build 17-21GW of new hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plants,
  says Chancellor

Facilities are expected to be used as back-up when there is not enough
wind or solar power to meet demand

Germany will build 17-21GW of new hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plants,
Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a speech this morning, according to Reuters.

“We are not losing sight of the goal of decarbonization: in order to
stabilise supply, we will build new gas-fired power plants which can be
operated with hydrogen in the future,” he told the VKU local utilities
association.

The prepared text of the speech, seen by Reuters, said the capacity of
these new facilities would amount to 17-21GW.

An internal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action document,
seen by the Euractiv news website in January, stated that 17-21GW of new
gas-fired capacity will need to be built by 2030-31 to provide back-up
power during low wind and low sun periods. This would be the most
cost-effective approach, the grid regulator, the Federal Network Agency
told the government, according to the document.

Robert Habeck, the minister for economic affairs and climate action, who
is also deputy chancellor, stated in February that the government would
be auctioning a “huge number” of hydrogen-fired power plants and other
back-up power capacity this year.

“We need a lot of power plant capacity that is not running
continuously,” he told an event organised by the German renewables
industry association BEE, adding that the plants will be needed to
provide power when wind and solar power were insufficient to meet demand.

“We have to act before the demand is there,” he said.

Last week,the German government awarded €28.4m ($30m) to a consortium to
build a hydrogen energy-storage pilot project
<https://www.hydrogeninsight.com/power/real-world-laboratory-hydrogen-energy-storage-pilot-plant-in-germany-gets-green-light-and-28m-grant/2-1-1410693> in eastern Germany that will be used as a “real-world laboratory” for the future conversion of existing conventional power plants to run on excess renewable energy.

That facility will use excess wind and solar power to produce green
hydrogen, and use that stored H_2 to produce power when required by the
grid — much like a gas-fired peaker plant.

The 17-21GW represents a massive increase in Germany’s gas-fired power
capacity, which amounted to 27.5GW in November last year.

Germany is planning to import huge amounts of green hydrogen in the
coming years, and has already launched international tenders to import
green ammonia, methanol and synthetic fuels made from renewable H_2
